title: Future of Coding
---

The Future of Coding community was started back in 2017 to channel the groundswell of interest in revisiting the foundations of our industry and practice, looking for underexplored alternatives to the status quo. Swirling in the air were revolutionary talks by Alan Kay, essays by Bret Victor, and projects like Eve and Elm and Enso. Indie researchers Andy Matuschak, Hundred Rabbits, and Ink & switch were surging in popularity. All while the software platforms offered by Apple, Google, and Microsoft began to feel less like a bicycle for the mind and more like a department store for the disinclined.

The community is a worldwide collective of computing enthusiasts, academic researchers, startup founders, indie researchers, and even a few curious onlookers. Members host regular meetups in London, NYC, and online, and there are occasionally gatherings scattered across the globe.

There is no unifying thesis or mission. Rather, we all share an interest in considering why things got to be the way they are, and where we might like them to go from here. Some are champions of novel tools like richly expressive visual programming, profoundly helpful type systems, or proactive debugging, others champion the social causes the contribute to our software malaise such as the awful lack of diversity in tech or the err of attending to social issues with technical solutions. Some want to rip everything down to the foundation and start over, others just want a nicer way to find the needle in a React stack.

The community is open and welcoming to all, and we invite you to join our deep discussions, enjoy our infrequently-published but lovingly crafted [podcast](https://futureofcoding.org/episodes), and [[contribute|Contributing]] to this wiki.
