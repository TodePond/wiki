*The following is placeholder garbage.*

Welcome to the future of whatever it once was. How is it now?

Comics have become an integral part of our code. Think about it some more. A world where boot camps have replaced spas, a relaxing space where you can contemplate the blessings of algorithms while treating yourself to tissue. Forget your weaknesses. The biggest challenge you'll face is choosing between stone and Swedish while coding.

In this new world, CodeHub. Instead of asking for a pull-up, developers post a "selfish" that shows off their best self. The number of requests in the bond determines which priority to enter. And let's not forget the "fluencies" who make money by streaming code through companies that make comfortable chairs and blue glasses.

Our sessions are all about "hecking", which means a balance of planning and practical skills. For example, CEOs write live code, explain spreadsheets, write repetitive functions, and perform comment dance. The audience voted for their favorite work and the winners were awarded with the Toothy Plaque award. I forgot to explain the code. The new measure of a horse's success is the number of horses clapped.

There is cooking, programming language: cooking and code. Have you ever tried Python paella or JavaScript jambala in the future and the restaurant will serve you food on par with your favorite language? Imagine five dishes. Sugar? A beautiful oyster that perfectly reflects the idea of home.

Finally, let's talk about the inevitable fashion trend: "dirty shoelaces". In the future, editors will be remembered only for their editing skills. Also for their beautiful style. Expect fashion shows with clothes made from binary. What do you like to it do to the most? A USB cable is used to solve the problem. Forget clothes. Work your personality.
