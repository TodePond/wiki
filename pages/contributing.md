Anyone is welcome to edit existing pages, or add new ones. The wiki is a git repo, currently hosted on GitHub for convenience. When you make an edit, open a Pull Request and we'll promptly merge it. If you're an active member of the community and frequent contributor to the wiki, we'll give you the commit bit.

Please note that all contributions are public domain.

We use our own markup language, a subset of Markdown called [[Tonedown]].

When you edit a page, add your name to the list of Contributors.

This wiki is young, and scrappy. We're still figuring out how it should work. If you'd like, take a look at the build script and see if you can improve it.
