### Everyone is welcome to add and edit any part of the wiki.

Below are some brief instructions for editing the wiki. But note well:Â this wiki is fledgling. We're still figuring out how it should work. If any of these instructions don't make sense, or if you have other questions, head to the **#present-company** channel in [our Slack](https://futureofcoding.org/community) and let us know.

The wiki is made of plain text files in a [repo on GitHub](http://github.com/futureofcoding/wiki). Feel free to clone the repo and edit it on your machine, or edit via the GitHub website. Whenever you make an edit, issue a pull request and we'll promptly merge it.

We use a subset of Markdown called [[Tonedown]], which keeps the `.md` extension but removes some lesser-used features for the sake of simplicity.

Each page begins with some "frontmatter" enclosed by triple dashes, followed by the page content. Here's an example:

```
---
title: Future of Coding (Podcast)
contributors: Ivan Reese, Kartik Agaram
---

The FoC community has [a podcast](futureofcoding.org/episodes) hosted by Ivan Reese, Jimmy Miller, and Lu Wilson.
```

The filename of each page is used for the URL, so keep that filename consistent with the title. For the example above, a good filename would be `future-of-coding-podcast.md`, so that the URL would be `/future-of-coding-podcast`.

When you edit a page, you're welcome to add your name to the list of contributors, if you'd like.

Please note that all contributions are public domain, and subject to our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/futureofcoding/code-of-conduct). We have a very low tolerance for self-promotion of products or companies. When in doubt, talk to us on [Slack](https://futureofcoding.org/community).
