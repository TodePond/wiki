### Everyone is welcome to add and edit.

Please note that all contributions are public domain, and are subject to the Future of Coding [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/futureofcoding/code-of-conduct).

The wiki is a git repo, currently hosted on GitHub for convenience. When you make an edit, open a Pull Request and we'll promptly merge it.

The wiki uses a subset of Markdown called [[Tonedown]].

When you edit a page, add your name to the list of Contributors.

This wiki is fledgling. We're still figuring out how it should work. To discuss the wiki, please use the **#present-company** channel in [our Slack](https://futureofcoding.org/community).
