### Everyone is welcome to add and edit any part of the wiki.

Below are some brief instructions for editing the wiki. But note well: this wiki is fledgling. We're still figuring out how it should work. If any of these instructions don't make sense, or if you have other questions, head to the **#present-company** channel in [our Slack](https://futureofcoding.org/community) and let us know.

When you click the "Edit this page" button, you'll be launched over to the [GitHub repo](http://github.com/futureofcoding/wiki) for the wiki, with an editor for the current page. Make whatever changes you like, then submit a pull request — we'll merge it ASAP.

If you'd like to add a new page, here's a handy tip. In your browser, go to the URL that you'd like your new page to have (eg: [wiki.futureofcoding.org/my-new-page](https://wiki.futureofcoding.org/my-new-page)). You'll be given a link to create this new page on Github with a pre-populated template and filename.

We use a subset of Markdown called [[Tonedown]], which keeps the `.md` extension but removes some lesser-used features for the sake of simplicity.

Each page begins with some "frontmatter" enclosed by triple dashes, followed by the page content. Here's an example:

```
---
title: Future of Coding (Podcast)
contributors: Ivan Reese, Kartik Agaram
---

The FoC community has [a podcast](futureofcoding.org/episodes) hosted by Ivan Reese, Jimmy Miller, and Lu Wilson.
```

The filename of each page is used for the URL, so keep that filename consistent with the title. For the example above, a good filename would be `future-of-coding-podcast.md`, so that the URL would be `/future-of-coding-podcast`.

When you edit a page, you're welcome to add your name to the list of contributors, if you'd like.

Please note that all contributions are public domain, and subject to our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/futureofcoding/code-of-conduct). We have a very low tolerance for self-promotion of products or companies. When in doubt, talk to us on [Slack](https://futureofcoding.org/community).
