# Future of Coding Wiki

Welcome to the Future of Coding Wiki!

We'll use this wiki to collect all sorts of references, projects, concepts, realizations, and other such bits of endearingly valuable knowledge that are surfaced by discussions in [our community](https://futureofcoding.org/community).

## Contributing

Everyone is welcome to contribute. Please feel free to edit _anything in the repo_ at any time in any way, and then submit a PR.

For more guidance, see the [Contributing](https://wiki.futureofcoding.org/contributing) page.

## Build Scripts

This wiki uses a build script to do a few things:

1. Expand the macros.
2. Convert markdown pages to HTML.
3. Add header/footer to HTML pages.

If you edit the wiki via the Github web interface, the build script will run automatically on every commit.

If you make a local clone of the wiki repo, you'll see that there's a `scripts` folder. Just ignore that for now — Ivan is still figuring out what it should be.
